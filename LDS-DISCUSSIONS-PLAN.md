# LDS Discussions Info — Full Content Build Plan

## Project Overview

**Site:** ldsdiscussions.info (WEBSITE_ID=6)  
**Purpose:** Scholarly one-for-one refutation of ldsdiscussions.com. Every page they have, we answer. Same menu structure. Same topic order. Better evidence.  
**Tone:** Academic. Citation-based. No emotional language. The refutation is more believable, more logical, and better sourced than the original claim. Every assertion is demonstrated and referenced.  
**Tool:** Claude uses the `webcms` MCP tools to create pages, write HTML, and publish. WEBSITE_ID must be 6.

---

## Workflow Per Page

Use `create_page_with_article` (single atomic call) — not the individual tools.  
This tool holds a semaphore so parallel agents cannot interleave DB writes.

1. `create_page_with_article` — creates article + page, uploads HTML to S3, links them, publishes both. Returns `pageId` and `articleId`.
2. `add_menu_item` — wire into navigation using the returned `pageId`

**Do not** call `create_article` / `create_page` / `update_page` / `publish_article` / `publish_page` individually for new pages — use the composite tool.

---

## HTML Styling (all article content)

Inline styles only — white/scholarly palette:

```
H1:        font-size:1.8em; font-weight:bold; color:#1a1f2e; margin:0 0 8px 0; font-family:Georgia,serif
H2:        font-size:1.3em; font-weight:bold; color:#1a1f2e; border-bottom:2px solid #c8a84b; padding-bottom:6px; margin:24px 0 14px 0
H3:        font-size:1.05em; font-weight:bold; color:#1a1f2e; margin:0 0 10px 0
Paragraph: font-size:0.97em; line-height:1.8; color:#1a1a1a; margin:0 0 14px 0; font-family:Georgia,serif
Blockquote (claim being refuted):
           border-left:3px solid #c8a84b; background:#fafafa; margin:20px 0;
           padding:12px 20px; color:#444; font-style:italic; font-size:0.97em
Citation:  font-size:0.82em; color:#555; margin:0 0 8px 0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif

## Task List (in order)

## Resuming on a New Machine

1. Pull the repo
2. Set env vars (see CLAUDE.md for full commands):
   - `WEBSITE_ID=6`
   - `MCP_API_KEY` (retrieve from deployed Lambda via CLAUDE.md instructions)
   - `LAMBDA_API_BASE_URL=https://usmczy4mu1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod`
3. `cd api/mcp && npm install`
4. Restart VS Code — the `webcms` MCP server starts automatically
5. Open this file and tell Claude: **"continue the ldsdiscussions build — next pages are listed under CURRENT STATUS"**

---

## CURRENT STATUS (last updated 2026-05-20)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ldsdiscussions.com BLOCKS WebFetch from agents
Use `mcp__webcms__fetch_source_page` for all ldsdiscussions.com URLs. WebFetch for all other sources (FAIR, Interpreter, BYU Studies, etc.) works fine.

### ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: create_page_with_article 500 errors
The first failed batch (permissions-blocked) left orphaned stub pages in the DB. If `create_page_with_article` returns a 500 error, agents should fall back to individual tools: `create_article` → `set_article_content` → `create_page` → `update_page` → `publish_article` → `publish_page`. This pattern worked reliably.

### ⚠️ PERMISSIONS REQUIRED
Ensure `.claude/settings.json` allow list includes:
- `mcp__webcms__fetch_source_page`
- `mcp__webcms__create_page_with_article`
- `WebSearch`
- `WebFetch`

## Agent Research Template

See **LDS-DISCUSSIONS-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md** at the repo root for the full agent prompt template.

Each content agent:
1. Fetches the ldsdiscussions.com source page (their exact argument)
2. Searches FAIR Mormon, Book of Mormon Central, Interpreter Foundation, Maxwell Institute,
   BYU Studies, LDS Essays, Gospel Library, and other apologetic sources
3. Fetches and reads the actual content of the best pages found
4. Synthesizes the strongest composite argument from all sources
5. Writes an EPIC, irrefutable, evidence-based HTML response — definitive, not casual
